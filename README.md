# CHAPTER 1 SUMMARY
This chapter mainly focuses about the introduction of the report from tackling the aims and objectives of the application and advantages of it. This chapter also include the methodology being used during the development process as well as the products of the software.
# CHAPTER 2 SUMMARY
This chapter summarizes the definition of the two models and generally overviews that it should be a mix of both incremental and waterfall processes plus major attributes of the software which include security, efficiency and maintainability.

# SYSTEM TESTING: 
Some techniques of system testing are:
- Integration Testing: Which is the testing that makes sure that the communication of the different parts of the system is working properly where the inputs and the outputs of the system are transported are being used efficiently for the best quality of the functions of the system to be achieved.
- Unit Testing: Which is the testing of the different parts of the system separately to check if each part is working correctly and doing what it is supposed to do efficiently according to its function in the system.
- User Testing: Which is the testing of the system as a whole after the system is implemented and the testing is done by people from the company or real users to check if there are any more bugs or if the system is missing any important details, and that is done when the application is still in its beta version. Additionally, in this testing the system is checked to see if it is up to the quality standards of the customer.
